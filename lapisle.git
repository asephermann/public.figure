Lapis legit, also known as spekkoek or Indonesian layer cake, is a rich, buttery dessert renowned for its dozens of thin, meticulously baked layers. Developed during the Dutch colonial era in Indonesia, it blends European baking techniques with aromatic local spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. 

Key Characteristics
Structure: A classic cake typically consists of 18 to 30 layers, earned it the nickname "thousand layer cake".
Ingredients: It is made with an exceptionally high number of egg yolks (sometimes 30 or more), high-quality butter (often Wijsman brand), sugar, and flour.
Flavor Profile: The taste is intensely rich, sweet, and fragrant with a unique spice blend including cardamom, mace, and anise.
Preparation: Unlike most cakes, it is baked layer-by-layer under a grill or broiler. Each thin layer must be poured, spread, and baked before the next is added, a process that can take several hours.
